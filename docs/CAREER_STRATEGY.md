# Career Acceleration Strategy
## .NET Lead/Architect → Maximum Compensation
## Generated: February 2026

---

## SITUATION ASSESSMENT

**Your position:** Lead/Architect level .NET developer based in Ukraine
**Your target:** Maximum compensation, any geography
**Market reality:** You're sitting on a goldmine. The spread between UA and US compensation is 3-5x. Your job is to close that gap.

---

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

1. **Your skills are worth $150K-250K/year** on the US market. If you're earning $5-8K/month in Ukraine, you're leaving $100K+ on the table annually.
2. **B2B contracting for US companies is the highest-ROI path.** Employment comes with overhead. Contracting at $100-150/hr puts you at $200-300K/year.
3. **English proficiency is your single biggest multiplier.** A C1+ developer earns 2-3x more than a B2 developer with identical technical skills.
4. **The AI wave is the best salary multiplier since cloud computing.** Architects who can integrate AI into enterprise .NET systems are commanding 30-50% premiums.

### 4.2 Negotiation Playbook

**Rule 1:** Never give your current salary. Say: "I'm targeting roles in the $X-Y range based on market data."

**Rule 2:** Always negotiate. First offer is never the best offer.

**Rule 3:** For US companies hiring internationally:
- Research the US salary for the role (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi)
- Expect 60-80% of US rate for remote international
- For B2B/contract, negotiate hourly rate not annual salary
- Include: home office stipend, equipment budget, conference budget

**Rule 4:** Competing offers are your best leverage. Apply broadly, stack offers.

**Anchor rates by target:**
- EU remote: €80K-120K ($6,500-10,000/mo)
- US remote employment: $120K-180K ($10,000-15,000/mo)
